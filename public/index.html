		<h1>Welcome to DDoS Detection Service</h1>
		<p>My web application provides a DDoS detection service through a web API. The application works by taking various parameters such as IP address, packet length, etc., as input through the web API and provides it to a machine learning model that classifies each record as "DDoS" or "Benign".</p>
		<h2>Get Started</h2>
